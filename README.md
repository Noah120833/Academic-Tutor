## 📖 App Description

The **English AI Tutor** is designed for language learners who want to improve their writing without sacrificing privacy. Unlike standard grammar checkers that send your data to the cloud, this application processes every sentence locally on your own machine.

The tutor doesn't just "fix" your mistakes; it explains the **why** behind the correction, acting like a private coach that helps you learn from your errors in real-time.
