**Precision Editing. Local Intelligence. Absolute Privacy.**

Dr. Aris is a specialized, AI-driven academic assistant designed to refine English prose to an Oxford-tier standard. Built with **React** and powered by **Ollama**, it provides high-fidelity linguistic feedback, CEFR level detection, and sophisticated word replacement—all without ever sending your data to the cloud.

## 🏛️ The Philosophy of Dr. Aris

In an era of cloud-based grammar checkers that harvest user data, Dr. Aris operates on a **Local-First** principle. Whether you are a researcher polishing a manuscript or a student mastering complex CEFR C1/C2 structures, Dr. Aris acts as your private academic mentor. Your intellectual property stays exactly where it belongs: on your machine.
